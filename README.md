# OpenHack ink! Starter ‚úíÔ∏è

Getting started with ink! smart contract development. This repository is made by OpenGuild community to educate newcomers about ink! smart contract development.

## What is `ink!`?

[Read a full article made by OpenGuild community member](https://hongthaipham.github.io/blog/2024/07/25/ink-your-way-to-decentralized-apps-a-polkadot-smart-contract-tutorial#3-implement-the-smart-contract).

Polkadot is not just another blockchain; it's a paradigm shift in blockchain architecture. Unlike traditional monolithic blockchains, Polkadot envisions a future of interconnected chains, ushering in a new era of cross-chain interoperability.

Imagine a network where specialized blockchains, each optimized for specific tasks, seamlessly communicate and transact with one another. This is the essence of Polkadot.

Ready to dive into the world of decentralized applications on Polkadot? This tutorial will guide you through building your first dApp using `Ink!`, Polkadot's powerful smart contract language.

We will walk you through every step, from writing your first smart contract to deploying it on the Polkadot network. Finally, This workshop tutorial show you how to interact with your creation using a built-in UI.

## üëâ Activity 1: Introduction to ink! and Polkadot {#session-1}

### What is ink!?

`Ink!` is a smart contract language developed by `Parity Technologies`. First introduced in 2018, Ink! has continued to evolve, with the latest version (as of this writing) being Ink! 5.0.

`Ink!` designed for `Substrate-based blockchains` comes with `Contract Pallet`, a runtime module that allows developers to deploy and execute smart contracts on the Polkadot network. It's based on `Rust`, a popular programming language known for its performance and safety features.

### Why ink!?

- **Performance:** Ink! smart contracts are compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm), enabling high performance and efficiency.

- **Safety:** Rust's strong type system and memory safety features help prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

### Setting up local development environment

- Install Rust: [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

If you already have Rust installed, update it to the latest version by running the following command:

```bash
rustup update
rustup component add rust-src
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

- Install `cargo-contract`

```bash
rustup component add rust-src
cargo install --force --locked cargo-contract
```
